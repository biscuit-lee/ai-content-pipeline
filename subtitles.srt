 Look at this chart right here. This shows the average time a customer spends inside a luxury boutique. And in 2024, the average person spends just 7 minutes inside a Chanel or Hermès store—that's less time than it takes to microwave a frozen burrito.

 And to make matters worse, we are constantly surrounded by psychological tricks designed to make us feel unworthy. The worst of these: 'intimidation retailing,' a practice designed to take advantage of our deep-seated desire for social status and belonging.

 So when you finally walk into that intimidatingly quiet Tiffany & Co. store, and you get that cold glance from the associate, you immediately think, 'I need to prove I belong here.' Why should I care about overspending? I don't know me 30 minutes from now. He can deal with that credit card bill.

 Intimidation retailing is a deliberate strategy of using cold service and minimalist design, offered by companies like Rolex, Apple, and even Tesla with their no-haggle pricing. You'll typically see these in high-end malls, offering you exclusivity. But it's not quite that simple. Why would a brand like Gucci actively try to make 90% of its visitors uncomfortable... and how does that actually make them more money?

 These intentionally exclusive retail environments aren't necessarily groundbreaking. In fact, the modern 'cool wall' is kind of a newer, digital-age version of the velvet rope policy you would see at legendary nightclubs like Studio 54 or exclusive department stores like the original Saks Fifth Avenue.
