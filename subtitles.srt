1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 Airlines are intentionally screwing you over.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,840
 And they're making billions doing it.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
 They sell tickets for seats that don't exist.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,280
 They create guaranteed conflict.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,760
 And they've turned public confrontations into a business strategy.

6
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,160
 In 2017, United Airlines literally dragged a doctor off Flight 3411.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,160
 Video went viral. Millions saw it. Stock price dipped.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,280
 But wait... here's what doesn't make sense.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,400
 Why would an industry built on customer satisfaction do this?

10
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,320
 Deliberately. Systematically.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,040
 Delta openly admits to overbooking flights.

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,920
 Southwest's own reports show they oversell constantly.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,640
 It's not a mistake. It's math.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,120
 Brilliant, ruthless, psychological math.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,760
 And once you see it, you'll understand every crowded gate you've ever been in.

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,040
 Let's start with the first principle. The No-Show Probability.

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,040
 Airlines don't see empty seats. They see lost revenue.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,560
 On any given flight, data shows 5-10% of people just... don't show up.

19
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,880
 Business meeting cancelled. Missed connection. Flat tire.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,360
 So they bet against you.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,560
 They sell 105 tickets for 100 seats.

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,080
 Statistically, it works. Almost always.

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,920
 But when it doesn't... that's where principle two kicks in.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,160
 The Cost-Benefit Analysis of Your Anger.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,880
 Yes, seriously. They've calculated the exact value of your frustration.

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,800
 An empty seat on a flight from New York to LA? That's a $500 loss.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,200
 But bumping one passenger?

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,600
 They have to compensate you. Maybe a $800 travel voucher.

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,720
 Wait, that seems like a loss too, right?

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,400
 Ah, but here's the devilish part.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
 Principle three: The Anchoring Effect.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,080
 That $800 voucher costs the airline far less than $800.

33
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,360
 They anchor you to the price of your ticketâ€”maybe $300.

34
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
 So $800 feels huge. A win!

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,000
 But they pay that voucher out over time. At a high discount rate.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
 Its real cost to them? Maybe $400 in future revenue.

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,280
 They'd rather risk a $400 cost than a guaranteed $500 loss.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,120
 It's a calculated gamble. And the math is overwhelmingly on their side.

39
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,360
 For every one person they drag off a plane...

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,640
 ...thousands of flights take off perfectly full, making them millions.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
 The final psychological trick? Diffusion of Responsibility.

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,000
 The gate agent isn't the villain. They're just following 'policy'.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,400
 The system is designed to absorb your anger.

44
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,520
 You're not mad at Delta. You're mad at the person offering you a voucher.

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,320
 It's corporate judo. They use your energy against you.

46
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,320
 And this pattern repeats everywhere.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,240
 Restaurants overbook reservations.

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,880
 Hotels oversell rooms.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,600
 They all play the odds against you.

50
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
 So the next time you're at a crowded gate...

51
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 You're not witnessing a logistical failure.

52
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,040
 You're watching a brilliantly cold, psychological algorithm play out in real time.

53
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,160
 You're not a customer. You're a data point.

54
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,360
 And for the airlines, that data point is worth a fortune.
