## 🚀 Overview
  
A personal project exploring AI agents for autonomous content creation. Built to experiment with how AI can coordinate multiple tools,language models, text to speech, image generation, and web search to complete multi-step creative tasks with minimal guidance.

This project is an **end-to-end AI content pipeline** that generates engaging audio-visual content from simple prompts. It combines **language models, web research, voice synthesis, and image generation** to produce professional-quality content quickly and efficiently.  

**Applications:** Podcast production, educational content, narrative storytelling, and social media content.
