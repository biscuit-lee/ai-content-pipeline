# 🎙️ AI-Powered Content Generation Pipeline

## 🚀 Overview
  
A personal project exploring AI agents for autonomous content creation. Built to experiment with how AI can coordinate multiple tools,language models, text to speech, image generation, and web search to complete multi-step creative tasks with minimal guidance.

## What It Can Create

- **Reddit-style stories** with emotional arcs and hooks
- **Podcast conversations** between two natural-sounding speakers  
- **Research-based content** using real web searches for accuracy
- **Videos with synchronized visuals** that match the audio content (current only surpport AI-generate images)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language Models:** Claude / GPT-4 via OpenRouter  
- **Voice Synthesis:** ElevenLabs, Kokoro, FastAPI server  
- **Image Generation:** Google Nano Banana  
- **Web Research:** Tavily API 
- **Backend:** FastAPI + AWS S3 storage  
- **Pipeline Orchestration:** Python async workflows  

---

## 🎯 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Improve image generation to support multiple images per section
- [ ] Add cinematic effects to videos (e.g., slow zoom, pan, etc.)
- [ ] Enable story regeneration with user provided improvement feedback

## 💭 What I Learned

- **Agent orchestration** – How to design systems where AI autonomously decides which tools to use
- **Multi step reasoning** – Breaking complex tasks into executable pipelines that maintain context
- **Tool integration** – Making multiple AI services work together reliably
- **Prompt engineering** – Crafting prompts that guide agent behavior across different content styles
- **System design** – Building modular architectures that can easily support new features (Story types, tts providers etc..)
