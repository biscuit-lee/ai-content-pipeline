# 🎙️ AI-Powered Content Generation Pipeline

## 🚀 Overview
  
A personal project exploring AI agents for autonomous content creation. Built to experiment with how AI can coordinate multiple tools—language models, text to speech, image generation, and web search to complete multi-step creative tasks with minimal guidance.

Focus Areas: Agent orchestration, multi-step reasoning, tool selection, and building pipelines where AI decides which tool to use and when.

## 💭 What I Learned

- **Agent orchestration** – How to design systems where AI autonomously decides which tools to use
- **Multi-step reasoning** – Breaking complex tasks into executable pipelines that maintain context
- **Tool integration** – Making multiple AI services work together reliably
- **Prompt engineering** – Crafting prompts that guide agent behavior across different content styles
- **System design** – Building modular architectures that can easily support new features
